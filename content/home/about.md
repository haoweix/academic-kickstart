# Biography

I am a Master student of [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), currently majoring in Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning. I have a internship at EMC Lab of Missouri University of Science and Technology in the summer of 2016. In 2017, I did my undergraduate thesis on Position-based Visual Servoing control under the guidance of [Prof. Ye Yuan](http://yy311.github.io/). From January this year, I am working with [Prof. Jeffrey Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/) on acceleating the sparse representation learning using sketching. I also participate in *BulePath* Project this year, which aims at helping visual impaired people navigate indoor spaces within BBB building and Kellogg Eye Center.
