# Biography

I am a Master student of [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), currently majoring in Signal & Image Processing and Machine Learning. I have a internship at EMC Lab of Missouri University of Science and Technology in the summer of 2016. In 2017, I have researched on position-based visual servoing control under the guidance of [Ye Yuan](http://yy311.github.io/). I am currently taking image processing, computer vision, machine learning courses. I also participate in *Beyster BulePath Project*, which aims at helping visual impaired people with indoor navigation.
